  <p>Reddit is cool. But there are times when you need to nuke your entire
  presence on the website. Deleting everything you've ever posted to the sites.
  Comments, self-posts and link-posts, the whole package.</p>

  <p>The process is pretty simple. First go <a href="{{ auth_url }}">
    authenticate</a> this site to make the changes on your behalf. Then a
  process will be started to nuke your account. It will take a little over 2
  seconds for each comment and submission you've ever made. So if you've made a
  bunch, then it might take a while.</p>

  <p>After that, all that's left is deleting the account itself. This step
  you'll need to take yourself by going to <a
    href="http://www.reddit.com/prefs/delete/">
    http://www.reddit.com/prefs/delete/</a> and clicking the delete button.
  Your account will now have been completely nuked.
