      <hr>
      <p>Reddit is cool. But there are times when you need to nuke your entire
      presence on the website. Deleting everything you've ever posted to the
      sites. Comments, self-posts and link-posts, the whole package.</p>

      <p>The process is pretty simple. First go <a href="{{ auth_url }}">
        authenticate</a> this site to make the changes on your behalf. Then
      a process will be started to nuke your account. It will take a little
      over 2 seconds for each comment and submission you've ever made. So if
      you've made a bunch, then it might take a while.</p>

      <p>After that, all that's left is deleting the account itself. This step
      you'll need to take yourself by going to <a
        href="http://www.reddit.com/prefs/delete/">
        http://www.reddit.com/prefs/delete/</a> and clicking the delete button.
      Your account will now have been completely nuked.
